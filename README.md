# Autonomous Driving Vision System
Team of 3  
Real-time traffic sign detection and lane tracking on Jetson TX2.  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, YOLOv4-Tiny, ONNX, TensorRT, Jetson TX2, GoPro  

- Trained YOLOv4-Tiny on a custom traffic sign dataset using Google Colab  
- Converted model to ONNX and deployed it with TensorRT for real-time inference  
- Implemented lane detection using OpenCV and sent lane position to STM32F407 for steering control
